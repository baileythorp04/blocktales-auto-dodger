just leave this running and itll dodge all of trotter's attacks for you in pit 49

## requirements
- have roblox open in full screen on your primary monitor
- monitor must be 1920x1080
- turn off low health effects in block tales settings (if they exist, i forgot)

## what you have to do
- you have to dodge the megaphone man yourself
- dodging doesn't work if an enemy dies immediately before an enemy attack, most commonly when you kill the megaphone man. so you still have to dodge at most a few times.
- it needs to keep track of what enemies are alive and in what positions. remember to use these shortcuts whenever an enemy dies or a ghost is summoned:
    - ctrl+(1,2,3,4) to remove enemy from given position 
    - shift+(1,2,3,4) to add ghost to given position
